I've been playing around a little with Azure Functions and Azure Alerting.
The design was to be able to utilize the Azure Alert rule processing function in Azure and have it create a prettier mail than what comes out of box.

Basically the design boiled down to having a few Azure Functions, A Storage Account with Tables and Queues a long with some PowerShell Magic :)

... more to come.. this is just a test/draft.
